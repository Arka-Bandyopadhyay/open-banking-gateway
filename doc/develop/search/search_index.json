Generally bank search is provided to prevent PSU from manually entering complicated bank identifiers. This bank search API allows for incremental keyword based search. Implementation Approaches We will distinguish between remote and local incremental search. Remote Incremental Search The remote incremental search is implemented on the server side. A rest endpoint receives a keyword and return a list of matching search entries. Use Case Steps Use cases for this API: 1. PSU loads FinTechSearchScreen 2. FinTechUI displays a search screen to the PSU 3. PSU enters any keyword in the search input field 4. FinTechUI forward request to FinTechAPI 5. FinTechAPI forward request to TppBankSearchApi 6. TppBankSearchApi returns a list of matching BankDescriptors to FinTechAPI 7. FinTechAPI returns a list of matching BankDescriptors to FinTechBankSearchUI 8. UI displays list of found bank descriptors to PSU Step 4. through 8. is repeated as long as PSU modifies keywords (by adding or removing characters) RemoteSearch-001, -002 FinTechUI.loadFinTechSeachScreen, displaySearchScreen RemoteSearch-003 FinTechUI.enterSearchString RemoteSearch-004 FinTechApi.bankSearch The FinTechUI sends a get request to the FinTechApi. Request contains * keyword (searchInput): The bank search input string * start (searchStartIndex): The index of the first result * max (searchMaxResult): the max number of entries to return with the response. * sessionState: provided as a path param. Used to read the FinTechLoginSessionCookie. * FinTechLoginSessionCookie: provided in the Cookie header. Used to identify the PSU. RemoteSearch-005, -006 TppBankSearchApi.bankSearch The FinTechApi sends a get request to the TppBankSearchApi. Request contains * keyword (searchInput): The bank search input string * start (searchStartIndex): The index of the first result * max (searchMaxResult): the max number of entries to return with the response. TppBankSearchApi returns a search result with following information. * List : found entries. * searchInput: The bank search input string (might have been normalized in the backend). * searchStartIndex: The index of the first result * searchMaxResult: The max number of entries to return with the response. * searchTotalResult: The total count of entities found for the given search input. RemoteSearch-007 FinTechApi return 200_BankSearchResult Result returned to FinTechUI contains same information as in RemoteSearch-005 and addition session management information like: * sessionState: provided in the response body. Used read the FinTechLoginSessionCookie. * FinTechLoginSessionCookie: provided in the Set-Cookie header. RemoteSearch-007 FinTechUI.displaySearchResult Finally, the FinTechUI display's the bank search result to the PSU. Local Incremental Search Local incremental search generally provides a way of reducing round trip to servers. So there is no local incremental search endpoint, but an endpoint to download the list of all BankProfiles. The client is then responsible for the indexing and the implementation of the search logic. For the purpose of keeping the client code simple, interface will also provide the possibility of downloading a standard lucene index file, as many platform provide login provide processing of lucene indexes. This approach will prevent each client from perfoming the expensive lucene indexing. The following diagram describes additional steps performed in the local incremental search. Use Case Steps Use cases for this API: 1. PSU loads FinTechSearchScreen 2. FinTechUI requests the BankSearchIndex from FinTechApi 3. FinTechApi requests the BankSearchIndex from TppBankSearchApi 4. TppBankSearchApi return BankSearchIndex to FinTechApi 5. FinTechApi return BankSearchIndex to FinTechUI 6. FinTechUI displays a search screen to the PSU 7. PSU enters any keyword in the search input field 8. FinTechUI call the search routine of the embedded LocalSearch 9. LocalSearch uses the keyword to retrieve the list of matching entries 10. LocalSearch returns a list of matching BankDescriptors to FinTechBankSearchUI 11. UI displays list of found bank descriptors to PSU Step 8. through 11. is repeated as long as PSU modifies keywords (by adding or removing characters) Like this diagram shows, local bank search does not send request to the network. LocalSearch-001 FinTechUI.loadFinTechSeachScreen PSU loads the FinTechSearchString of the FinTechUI. LocalSearch-101, -103 FinTechApi.bankSearch The FinTechUI sends a get request to the FinTechApi. If the List is not yet loaded by the FinTechUI, the FinTechUI issues a bankSearch request to the FinTechApi. A keyword passed as query parameter allows the backend to reduce the initial extent of records included in the index. keyword (searchInput): The bank search input string. Must be used to reduce the extent of records to be included in the local search. E.g.: c=DE could limit the search to bank in Germany. start (searchStartIndex): The index of the first result. The start will be set to 0 to get all records. max (searchMaxResult): the max number of entries to return with the response. Set this number to -1 to receive all applicable records from the server. sessionState: provided as a path parameter. Used to read the FinTechLoginSessionCookie. FinTechLoginSessionCookie: provided in the Cookie header. Used to identify the PSU. TppBankSearchApi returns a search result with following information. * List : found entries. * searchInput: The bank search input string (might have been normalized in the backend). * searchStartIndex: The index of the first result * searchMaxResult: The max number of entries to return with the response. * searchTotalResult: The total count of entities found for the given search input. LocalSearch-102, -103 TppBankSearchApi.bankSearch The FinTechApi sends a get request to the TppBankSearchApi. Request contains * keyword (searchInput): The bank search input string * start (searchStartIndex): The index of the first result * max (searchMaxResult): the max number of entries to return with the response. TppBankSearchApi returns a search result with following information. * List : found entries. * searchInput: The bank search input string (might have been normalized in the backend). * searchStartIndex: The index of the first result * searchMaxResult: The max number of entries to return with the response. * searchTotalResult: The total count of entities found for the given search input. LocalSearch-104 FinTechApi return 200_BankSearchResult Result returned to FinTechUI contains same information as in LocalSearch-103 and addition session management information like: * sessionState: provided in the response body. Used read the FinTechLoginSessionCookie. * FinTechLoginSessionCookie: provided in the Set-Cookie header. LocalSearch-105 displaySearchScreen LocalSearch-106 .. 110 enterKeyword, LocalSearch.search As the PSU enters search keywords, the FinTechUI issues a search request to the LocalSearch that performs the search operation locally and returns corresponding result that is displayed to the PSU on the go. New Idioms Discriminator The searchInput object passed to FinTechApi in this case is called discriminator and is used to reduce the extent of records to be included in the local search. E.g.: c=DE could limit the search to bank in Germany. If for example the TPP does not support some banks, he can include that information in the searchInput-String. LocalSearch This is the UI-Komponent that operates (like lucene) on a local search index in the UI-Application. The technology used to implement this search is specific to the UI technology. JavaScript based technologies might use tools like: elasticlunr Caching List The List return for the purpose of a local search can be cached by the FinTechApi to reduce quantity of request issued to the TppBankSearchApi","title":"Search bank"},{"location":"architecture/2-searchBank/#psu-searches-bank-by-keyword","text":"","title":"PSU Searches Bank By Keyword"},{"location":"architecture/2-searchBank/#definition","text":"Describes the bank search functionality in a FinTech Application.

InitConsent-031 : FinTechApi.loadPsuConsentSession A PsuConsentSession is a reusable token, that can be used to request service with the TppBankingApi. It is a reference to the PSU in the world of the TPP. Whether a service request is covered by an existing PsuConsent is decided by the TppBankingApi. The Task of the FinTechApi is to load any existing PsuConsentSession and associate it with the PSU request to the TPP. InitConsent-040 : TppBankingApi.listTransactions Forward of the PSU request to TPP with following associated context informations: FinTechContext contains identification information associated with the FinTech.

Use the loaded TppConsentSession to retrieve an existing consent and proceed to the ASPSP with the service request. No Suitable Consent Present InitConsent-060 : Initiating a Consent with the ASPSP If there is no suitable consent available, the BankingProtocol will first proceed with a consent initiation request. This is, an initiated service request will either ends up in the expected service response or first redirect the PSU to the ConsentAuthorisationApi . Whether this operation is necessary or not depends on the AspspBankingApi interface. The selected banking protocol will know how to deal with this. UserAgentContext See UserAgentContext TppContext The Associated TppContext contains Tpp identifying information. AisConsent The AisConsent object contains information associated with the service request. InitConsent-061 : ConsentInit Response The response of the consent init request depends on the ASPSP implementation. It generally provides information needed to collect PSU identification information in the embedded case or information needed to redirect the PSU to the OnlineBankingApi . The result of a consent init session also carries an TppConsentSession , containing all information needed to be stored by the Tpp for the reference of the started consent session. InitConsent-062 : BankingProtocol calls RedirectSessionStoreApi for a redirectCode InitConsent-063 : RedirectSessionStoreApi The RedirectSessionStoreApi will encrypt and store the redirect session, indexing it with a redirectCode that can be used upon redirection by the ConsentAuthorisationApi to retrieve the corresponding TppConsentSession .

These are: - PSU banking identifier information known as (psuId, psuCorporateId) - PSU account details information (like account numbers, iban, ...) - PSU payment orders (including beneficiary names, amounts, ...) - PSU authentication methods All these information are stored in different devices during the consent authorization session. Form of storages are among others: - Held in the browser page for display to the PSU - Stored in the Cookie for reuse by the corresponding backend - Stored in backend databases for transfer to other server components - Stored in backend databases for reuse by server components. For the purpose of protecting these data, framework is designed to always have consent data encrypted while at rest or on transit. General logic is that encrypted payload and encryption key do not reside in the same environment, unless need for decryption and processing of those data. Following object hold consent data - TppConsentSession - RedirectSession - PsuConsentSession PsuUserDevice A PSU user device runs applications used by the PSU to access banking functionality. Those applications are generally called PsuUgerAgents. PsuUserAgent Application running on a PSU device and used by the PSU to access banking functionality. We are describing the two main types of PsuUserAgents. WebBrowser A Web browser is considered compliant in the context of this framework when it can protect specific information used between the PusUserDevice and the the corresponding server application to track the user session. For session tracking, this framework uses Cookies RFC6265 . Redirection and Data Sharing We assume all three applications FinTechApi, ConsentAuthorisationApi, OnlineBankingApi are hosted on different domains. This is, we are not expecting Cookies set by one application to be visible to another application (this might still happen on some local development environment, where everything runs on localhost). We also do not advice adding persistent information to RedirectUrl , as these are log files everywhere on infrastructure components in data centers. RedirectUrl shall instead carry OneTime and ShortLived authorization code we call code , that can be used to retrieved shared payload through an authenticated back channel connection. This is the practice borrowed from oAuth2 RFC6749 . Following table shows defined redirects and corresponding back chanel endpoints. Origin Application Redirecting Application Response Code; Location ; AuthCodeParam; Expiration Redirect Target Application Destination Application Data EndPoint at Origin Application TppBankingApi FinTechApi 302 ; /auth ; code ; 5s ConsentAuthorisationApi ConsentAuthorisationApi /loadTppConsentSession ConsentAuthorisationApi ConsentAuthorisationApi Proprietary banking API.

This framework uses following terms to name the session information held by an application on the UserAgent of the PSU. Application SessionCookie FinTechApi Psu2FintechLoginSession ConsentAuthorisationApi ConsentAuthSessionCookie OnlineBankingApi OnlineBankingConsentSessionCookie Session information can also be kept across redirect life cycles. Upon redirecting the UserAgent to another application, the redirecting application can set Cookies that will be resent to the domain with future requests. This way, there will be no need to maintain user session information in temporary databases on the server, thus keeping server tiny. Native App The UserAgent might be a native application running on a user mobile device or a desktop computer. In this case, redirection might still take place, but with consideration of the physical transition between source and target UI-Application. Following specifications deal with security threads associated with the redirection between UI-Application on a user device: RFC8252:OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps , RFC7636:Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients For the purpose of kepping the overall architecture of this framework simple, we will require native applications to provide the same behavior as the WebBrowser described above. UserAgentContext Independent on the type of PsuUgerAgent, OpenBanking interfaces will require transmission of a class of information associated with the PsuUserAgent so they can perform verification of the authenticity of the original PSU request and customize the response produced for intermediary layers. We group these data under the name \"UserAgentContext\". Following header names account among the UserAgentContext: IP-Address, IP-Port, Accept, Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, Device-ID, User-Agent, Geo-Location, Http-Method. FinTechUI UI Application running on the PsuUserAgent and used by the PSU to access the FinTechApi ConsentAuthorisationUI UI used by PSU to authoraise consent in embedded case. OnlineBankingUI This UI manages the interaction between the PSU and the ASPSP in redirect cases. FinTech Organisation that uses Online Banking Services provided by TPP to service PSU with additional services. FinTech may or may not have own TPP License. FinTechDC Data center environment of the FinTech. Host the FinTechApi. FinTechApi Financial web service provided by the FinTech. Tpp Data Center Data center environment of the TPP TppBankingApi Tpp backend providing access to ASPSP banking functionality. This interface is not directly accessed by the PSU but by the FinTechApi. FinTechApi will use a FinTechContext to authenticate with the TppBankingApi. TppBankSearchApi Repository of banks maintained in the TPP's banking gateway. The banking search API will later presen an interface to configure profiles attached to listed banks. BankDescriptor Descriptive information assocaited with a bank like: - The name of the Bank - The address of the bank - The bank identification code BankProfile BankingApi profile information associated with a bank like: - The BankingProtocol used to connect with the bank - List of Banking services provided by the BankingApi of the bank - SCA approcahes associated with the BankingApi - ScaUIMetadaData: Screens and field used to collect user authentication data. - Actions to be performed by the PSU prior to using the BankingProtocol AisConsentSpec Specification associated with an AisConsent. This is highly dependent on the BankProfile. Following information might be carried by an AisConsentSpec object: - recurringIndicator - validUntil - frequencyPerDay - combinedService - accountAccessTemplate - availableAccounts[availableAccountsWithBalances, allAccounts] - allPsd2[allAccounts] FinTechContext Information used to identify the FinTech application at the TppBankingApi. For example a FinTech SSL client certificate or an APIKey or an oAuth2 Password Grant Credential. PSU A Payment Services User is a natural or legal person making use of a payment service as a payee, payer or both. PsuConsentSession Information associated with the consent as exchanged between the FinTechApi and the TppBankingApi. Generally contains: - Data needed to customize psu access at the ConsentAuthorisationApi (showInfoPanel, fintechStateHash) - Data needed to manage redirection of PSU from the TppConsentSession to the FintechUI like (FinTech-Redirect-URI, FinTech-Nok-Redirect-URI, FinTech-Explicit-Authorisation-Preferred, FinTech-Content-Negotiation) Object also contains information associated with the PSU requesting service if available. - The identifier of the PSU in the realm of the Tpp PsuIdentifier - Existing Consent References if any. PsuIdentifier This is the identifier of the PSU in the FinTech2Tpp relationship. This identifier can be saved once a consent has been successfully established to allow for reuse of existing consent in future sessions. ConsentAuthorisationApi Interface used by the PSU to authorize a consent. SessionCookie and XSRF We assume all three applications FinTeApi, ConsentAuthorisationApi, OnlineBakingApi maintain their own session information with corresponding UIs. We assume those APIs use cookies to maintain session with the corresponding user agents. In the context of this framework, those cookies are called SessionCookies. We also expect a following behavior from APIs and UserAgents: A response that sets a SessionCookie also carries a corresponding X-XSRF-TOKEN in the response header. A request that authenticates with a session cookie must also add the X-XSRF-TOKEN to the request header. RedirectSession Holds consent information for the duration of a redirect. Redirect patterns are described below . BankingProtocol Component managing access to a banking interface initiative. WE will have to deal with many protocols like NextGenPSD2, HBCI, OpenBanking UK, PolishAPI. BankingProtocolSelector Help select a banking protocol. Aspsp Data Center Data center environment of the ASPSP ASPSP Account Servicing Payment Service Providers provide and maintain a payment account for a payer as defined by the PSRs and, in the context of the Open Banking Ecosystem are entities that publish Read/Write APIs to permit, with customer consent, payments initiated by third party providers and/or make their customers\u2019 account transaction data available to third party providers via their API end points. AspspBankingApi Api banking provided by ASPSP. This interface is not directly accessed by the PSU but by the TppBankingApi. TppBankingApi will use a TppContext to authenticate with the TppBankingApi. TppContext Information used to identify the Tpp application in the ASPSP environment. Like a TPP QWAC certificate. TppConsentSession Storage for consent data in the realm of the BankingProtocol. The banking protocol is both accessible to the TppBankingApi and the ConsentAuthorizationApi. The cryptographic key needed to recover the TppConsentSession is always delivered by the calling layer. These are: - FinTechUI -> FinTechApi -> TppBankingApi -> BankingProtocol : in this case the key needed to recover the TppConsentSession in contained in the PsuConsentSession. Generally that key will transitively originate from an interaction with the user agent. - CosentAuthorizationUI -> CosentAuthorizationApi -> BankingProtocol : in this case the key needed to recover the TppConsentSession originate from the ConsentAuthSessionCookie. Beside consent data, additional data might be held in the TppConsentSession: - FinTechContext : Data needed to authorize the FinTechApi (FinTechSSLCertificate, ApiKey, SignedJWT) - Additional information needed for interaction between TPP and ASPSP but without any concern to the PSU. OnlineBankingApi Generally the online banking application on an ASPSP. In redirect cases, the ASPSP OnlineBankingApi establishes a direct session with the PSU to allow the PSU to identify himself, review and authorize the consent. OnlineBankingConsentSessionCookie This is a Cookie used to maintain the session between the OnlineBankingUI and the OnlineBankingApi. As a recommendation, the validity of this Cookie shall be limited to the life span of the consent session. As the OnlineBankingApi redirects the PSU back to the ConsentAuthorisationApi up on completion of the consent session. Redirection happens independently on whether the consent was authorized or not. OnlineBanking2ConsentAuthRedirectInfoPage It is recommended to inform the PSU prior to redirecting the PSU back to the TPP. This UI-Panel will be called OnlineBanking2ConsentAuthRedirectInfoPage. If the ASPSP is using a trusted environment (Native App) and wants to keep the relationship to the PSU alive, it is necessary to store this relationship in a separated OnlineBankingLoginSessionCookie. OnlineBankingLoginSessionCookie This Cookie will be used by the ASPSP to keep a login session of the PSU over the life span of consent session. This will prevent the PSU from performing the login step for upcoming consent sessions. TPP A TPP is a Third Party Provider - a legal entity that holds a TPP License provided by NCA (PISP, AISP etc). and operates with corresponding QWAC Certificate. TPP may serve FinTech companies with XS2A Services.","title":"Dictionary"},{"location":"architecture/dictionary/#dictionary","text":"AisConsentSpec App ASPSP AspspBankingApi BankDescriptor BankingProtocolSelector BankingProtocol BankProfile ConsentAuthorisationApi ConsentAuthorisationUI ConsentData Dictionary FinTech FinTechApi FinTechContext FinTechDC FinTechUI Information OnlineBanking2ConsentAuthRedirectInfoPage OnlineBankingApi OnlineBankingConsentSessionCookie OnlineBankingLoginSessionCookie OnlineBankingUI PSU PsuConsentSession PsuIdentifier PsuUserAgent PsuUserDevice RedirectSession SessionCookie Sharing TppBankingApi TppBankSearchApi TppConsentSession TppContext TPP UserAgentContext WebBrowser","title":"Dictionary"},{"location":"architecture/dictionary/#redirection-and-data-sharing","text":"We assume all three applications FinTechApi, ConsentAuthorisationApi, OnlineBankingApi are hosted on different domains.

This is, the PSU might be interacting with up to three different legal entities to consume a single banking/payment service (FinTech, TPP and ASPSP). Therefore, the entire OpenBanking service flow involves the initiation, authorization and confirmation of the banking/payment service. The integrity of the entire service flow is only given if we can verify that: - the PSU that controls the credentials used to identify at the FinTech interface and initiate a banking/payment service at that FinTech interface is the same natural person as the PSU that controls the credential used to identify at the TPP interface for the purpose of authorizing that initiated banking service , and that - the PSU that controls the credentials used to identify at the TPP interface for the purpose of authorizing an initiated banking service is the same natural person as the PSU that controls the credentials used to identify at the ASPSP interface with the purpose of authorizing that initiated banking service at the ASPSP interface, and that - the PSU that controls the credentials used to identify at the ASPSP interface and authorize an initiated banking service is the same natural person as the PSU that finally identifies at the FinTech interface to confirm that authorized banking/payment service. We call this relation the PSU identities equivalence . This is, ensuring integrity of the overall PSU OpenBanking service flow boils down to the verification of the equivalence of involved PSU identities (psu-id@fintech ==> psu-id@tpp ==> psu-id@aspsp). Therefore, the purpose of this work is to analyze interactions to be performed between a PSU and those three legal entities while initiating, authorizing and confirming a banking/payment service, and then provide recommendations on how to secure those interactions such as to maintain the integrity of the banking service consumed. The following picture depicts participants and interfaces used in this concept. Core Participants PSU A Payment Service User is any natural person that uses a banking or payment service on behalf of himself or on behalf of another natural person or legal entity. Form the perspective of this analysis, a PSU: - is a natural person, - is in possession of some personal non sharable online banking credentials, - uses applications running on some devices to interact with online services, - can act on behalf of himself, another natural or legal person, ASPSP An Account Servicing Payment Service Provider is a legal entity maintains payment account for natural and/or legal person. Form the perspective of this analysis, an ASPSP: - might provides an online interface for use by a PSU to authorize of a consent (OnlineBankingApi), - might provide an application for use by the PSU for use by the PSU to access the OnlineBankingApi (OnlineBankingUI), - provides an online interface for use by a TPP for online access to banking services (OpenBankingApi), - might provide an online interface for use by a TPP to forward PSU consent authorization to the ASPSP (OpenBankingApi) The psu-id@aspsp is the identity of the PSU as known to the ASPSP. This identity generally matches an online banking identifier in the realm of the ASPSP. TPP A Third Party Provider is a legal entity that implements access to ASPSP OpenBanking interfaces. A TPP is a regulated entity that implements legal provisions to protect PSU banking data obtained from OpenBankingApis. Market practices show that some TPPs are setup to service other entities (FinTech) with access to banking services. Form the perspective of this analysis, a TPP: - provides an online interface for the management of PSU consents (ConsentAuthorisationApi) - provides an application for use by the PSU to authorize consent in the embedded approach (EmbeddedConsentUI). This same application can also be used to present redirect info pages to the PSU (RedirectInfoPage). - provides an online interface for use by a FinTech to access banking services (TppBankApi, TppBankSearchApi), The psu-id@tpp is the PSU as known to the TPP. If TPP environment is designed to service a single FinTech, this identity can be set equal to the psu-id@tpp . If a TPPenvironment services multiple FinTech entities, the TPP will have to establish a separated PSU identity that references all corresponding FinTech identities. This requirement only exists because some OpenBanking specifications do not allow TPP to maintain multiple valid consents of the same type on the same bank account. In a situation where the TPP uses the same account information consent to service many FinTech, a TPP consent management layer must allow a PSU to revoke that consent for a designated FinTech without revoking the consent at the ASPSP level. FinTech A FinTech is a legal entity that provides some sort of aggregated online banking/payment services to other natural and legal people. Form the perspective of this analysis, a FinTech: - provides an online interface for use by a PSU to access banking services (FinTechApi), - provides an application for use by the PSU to consume banking services (FinTechUI, FinTechSearchUI). The psu-id@fintech is the identity of the PSU in the realm of the FinTech, as most FinTech applications require the PSU to establish an identity before using the application. This is the most important identity as it covers the consumption of the banking/payment services. Further identities (tpp, aspsp) are only needed for authorization. This framework is designed such as to request the FinTech to provide a permanent unique identity of each PSU to the TPP. PsuUserDevice A PsuUserDevice runs applications used by the PSU to access banking services. Those applications are generally called PsuUserAgents. Sample PSU user devices are Personal Computers, Mobile Phones or even SecureId Token devices. PsuUserAgent A PsuUserAgent is an application running on a PsuUserDevice and used by the PSU to access banking functionality. PsuUserAgents are either web applications running on a standard web browser or native applications. A web browser is considered compliant with this framework when : - it can protect access to cookies. - it can manage redirection as defined by the http specification. For uniformity, we require native applications considered compliant with this framework to provide the same behavior as a compliant web browser based PsuUgerAgent with respect to cookie management and redirection. Following specifications deal with security threads associated with the redirection between UI-Applications on a PsuUserDevice: RFC8252:OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps , RFC7636:Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients . UserAgentContext Independent on the type of PsuUgerAgent, OpenBanking interfaces will require transmission of a class of information associated with the PsuUserAgent so they can perform verification of the authenticity of the original PSU request and customize the response produced for intermediary layers. We group these data under the name \"UserAgentContext\". Following header names account among the UserAgentContext: IP-Address, IP-Port, Accept, Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, Device-ID, User-Agent, Geo-Location, Http-Method. Security Considerations This work deals with details associated with the verification that the natural person that controls credentials used to authorize the initiation of a banking service at the TPP or ASPSP interface also controls credentials used to initiated that service at the FinTech interface. This is, we want to prevent the owner of some online banking credentials to involuntarily use them to authorize a banking service initiated by another natural person. Cookies The first measure consists in protecting a session established between a PsuUgerAgent and a ServerApplication (FinTechApi, ConsentAuthorizeApi). The use of Cookies RFC6265 provides the most elaborated way to protect a session established between a PsuUgerAgent and a ServerApplication. We assume a PsuUgerAgent storing a cookie fulfills following requirements: - Cookies carrying the attribute HttpOnly are not provided access to scripts run by a web browser based UserAgent. Native applications designed for banking services must undergo thorough security reviews to make sure they fulfill this requirement. - Cookies carrying the attribute Secure are only sent to the server over SSL connections. - Expired Cookies (attribute Expires, Max-Age ) are not sent to the server. - Cookies set with no value ( SessionCookie=; ) are deleted from the UserAgent. - Cookies shall never be transmitted to a domain not matching it origin. - In the same domain, cookies shall only be transmitted to the configured path. SessionCookie and XSRF We assume all three applications FinTeApi, ConsentAuthorisationApi, OnlineBakingApi maintain their own session information with corresponding UIs. We assume those APIs use cookies to maintain session with the corresponding PsuUserAgents. In the context of this framework, those cookies are called SessionCookies. We also expect a following behavior from APIs and UserAgents: * A response that sets a SessionCookie also carries a corresponding X-XSRF-TOKEN in the response header. * A request that authenticates with a SessionCookie must also add the X-XSRF-TOKEN to the request header. * Server must match X-XSRF-TOKEN against SessionCookie before proceeding with the request. Redirection The server can request the PsuUgerAgent to redirect the user to another application by returning an \"HTTP 302\" response code to the PsuUserAgent. The way a PsuUserAgent proceeds with a location URL depend on the nature and the configuration of the host PsuUserDevice. The handling of redirection in native applications environments is well handled in OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps RFC8252 . We will be using redirection to switch the user context from one application to another one. Following redirection will generally be found in this framework: - FinTechApi to-> ConsentAuthorisationApi - ConsentAuthorisationApi to-> OnlineBankingApi - OnlineBankingApi backTo-> ConsentAuthorisationApi - ConsentAuthorisationApi backTo-> FinTechApi We assume all three ServerApplications (FinTechApi, ConsentAuthorisationApi, OnlineBankingApi) are hosted on different domains. This is, we do not expect cookies set by one ServerApplication to be visible to another ServerApplication. We assume UiApps (OnlineBankingUI, EmbeddedConsentUI, FinTechUI/FinTechSearchUI) do not share context information. They can only interact with each other by the way of the hosting PsuUserDevice using the URL provided by the source UiApp to open the target UIApp. Redirection and XSRF As we can not protect/control redirection on user device, known internet based identity protocols like oAuth2 make use of the state parameter to store information that will be sent back to the redirection source and used by the redirection source to verify that the user was sent back to the original source UIApp. This is, implementing XSRF for redirection consists in storing a RedirectCookie in the source UIApp and adding a corresponding XSRF-Token to the state parameter. Redirection and Data Sharing We also do not advice adding too many persistent information to the redirection URL, as these are all logged in files everywhere on infrastructure components in data centers. If we have any bulky information to share between the source UIApp and the target UIApp, we can add a OneTime and ShortLived authorization code we called redirectCode to RedirectUrl . This redirectCode can be used at target to retrieved shared payload (generally through an authenticated back channel connection). This is the practice borrowed from oAuth2 RFC6749 . Identity Equivalence When a PSU initiate a banking service at the FinTech interface (FinTechApi), the processing TPP will initiate a consent authorization process if needed (TppBankingApi). Once a consent authorization process is initiated by the TppBankingApi, we want to make sure that the PSU giving his consent (psu-id@tpp, psu-id@aspsp), is the same as the PSU requesting the service at the FinTech interface (psu-id@fintech). Ensuring the equivalence of those identities can be represented as (assuming alice and bob are PSUs): alice@fintech ==> alice@tpp ==> alice@aspsp // Where alice@fintech ==> alice@tpp neans the person identified at the FinTechApi as alice@fintech controls the necessary credentials used to identify at the ConsentAuthorisationApi as alice@tpp This is, the integrity of the OpenBanking PSU Contract is broken when security breaches can be used to compromise these equivalences like in the following pseudo code: bob@fintech ==> alice@tpp ==> alice@aspsp // although in reality bob@fintech =/=> alice@tpp // In this case bob identifies with the FinTechApi (as bob@fintech) but manipulates alice to identify with the ConsentAuthorisationApi and provide her consent for the requested banking service. bob@fintech ==> bob@tpp ==> alice@aspsp // although in reality bob@tpp =/=> alice@aspsp // In this case bob identifies with the FinTechApi and the ConsentAuthorisationApi but manipulates alice to identify with the OnlieBankingApi and provide her consent for the requested banking service. Step-1: Identify PSU at the FinTechApi We always expect the PSU to be identified at the FinTechApi interface. So we assume that the psu-id@fintech is known. The integrity of the rest of the contract relies on the capability of the FinTech to protect the session associating the PSU to the FinTechApi. The service request itself is always initiated by the FinTechApi. Before initiation, we assume that the PSU (alice) has signed into the FinTechApi and her identity is known to the FinTechApi and thus associated with the service request forwarded to the TppBankingApi. Step-2: Store psu-id@fintech with the ConsentAuthorizationSession While processing a service request, if the TPP notices that the service request is not covered by a consent (either as a result of pre-checking for the consent or from an error returned by the ASPSP's OpenBankingApi), the TPP will trigger a new consent authorization process identifies by an auth-id and called ConsentAuthorizationSession . Starting a new ConsentAuthorizationSession, we require the TPP to store the FinTech identity of the service requesting PSU alice@fintech with the ConsentAuthorizationSession record before initiating a redirect to the ConsentAuthorisationApi. This is, the ConsentAuthorizationSession record stored in the TPP Database has the state: // Syntax: [index+]=ConsentAuthorizationSession[data] [auth-id,redirectCode]=ConsentAuthorizationSession[auth-id,redirectCode, alice@fintech, ConsentData] // Where redirectCode is a one time key that can be used by the ConsentAuthorisationApi once to retrieve the ConsentAuthorizationSession. // Where auth-id is the identifier of this ConsentAuthorizationSession Step-2: Identify PSU at the TPP ConsentAuthorisationApi At first, redirecting a PSU from the FinTechApi to the TPP ConsentAuthorisationApi does not establish any relationship between the PSU and the TPP, even if we can use the redirectCode associated with the redirected URL to retrieve ConsentAuthorisationSession. Of course the ConsentAuthorisationApi knows that the ConsentAuthorizationSession was initiated by alice@fintech, but this does not mean that the PSU controlling the current PsuUserAgent (known as ConsentAuthorisationUI) is the same natural person as the one controling the identity alice@fintech. In order to proceed with the ConsentAuthorisationSession, the TPP ConsentAuthorisationApi will have to establish an identification of the natural person controlling the UserAgent, resulting in a new PSU identity called (psu-id@tpp). This PSU identity (psu-id@tpp) is associated with the ConsentAuthorisationSession upon successful authentication of the PSU at the TPP ConsentAuthorisationApi interface. At this stage, the ConsentAuthorizationSession record stored in the TPP Database has the following state: [auth-id,redirectCode]=ConsentAuthorizationSession[auth-id,redirectCode, alice@fintech, alice123@tpp, ConsentData] // But with the assumption that alice@fintech =/=> alice123@tpp. // Meaning that both identities are not yet verified equivalent (controlled by the same natural person) Even though the ConsentAuthorizationSession in the TPP database is associated with two identities (alice@fintech and alice123@tpp), there is no proof that both identities alice@fintech and alice123@tpp are controlled by the same natural person. Step-3a: ConsentAuthorisation at the TPP's ConsentAuthorisationApi (Embedded-sca) In an Embedded-SCA case, the credentials associated with psu-id@aspsp are collected by the ConsentAuthorisationApi and forwarded to the OpenBankingApi of the ASPSP. In this case it is easy to assume uniqueness between both psu-id@tpp and psu-id@aspsp as both are done within the same user session at the same interface. This results in the following record after a successful embedded consent authorization at the ConsentAuthorisationApi: [auth-id,redirectCode]=ConsentAuthorizationSession[auth-id,redirectCode, alice@fintech, alice123@tpp, alice-s@aspsp, ConsentData, alice123@tpp==>alice-s@aspsp] // Where alice@fintech =/=> alice123@tpp. // Meaning that both identities are not yet verified equivalent (owned by the same natural person) // Where alice123@tpp ==> alice-s@aspsp. // Meaning alice123@tpp could provide the banking credentials of alice-s@aspsp. Even in this embedded case, there is still a missing equivalence between alice@fintech and alice-s@tpp . Step-3b: Identify PSU at the ASPSP's OnlineBankingApi (Redirect-sca) In a Redirect-SCA case (oauth, redirect, decoupled), the PSU has to be redirected by the ConsentAuthorisationApi to the OnlienBanking interface of the ASPSP. After a successful consent authorization at the OnlienBanking interface, the record could be updated by the mean of poling the authorization status of this ConsentAuthorizationSession at the OpenBankingApi of the ASPSP. Upon successful authorization of the requested consent, the ConsentAuthorizationSession in the database of the TPP looks like: [auth-id,redirectCode]=ConsentAuthorizationSession[auth-id,redirectCode, alice@fintech, alice123@tpp, alice-s@aspsp, ConsentData] // Where alice@fintech =/=> alice123@tpp. // Meaning that both identities are not yet verified equivalent (owned by the same natural person) // Where alice123@tpp =/=> alice-s@aspsp. // Meaning that both identities are not yet verified equivalent (owned by the same natural person) Step-4: Verify Equivalence between psu-id@aspsp and psu-id@tpp (Redirect-sca) After a successful consent authorization at the OnlineBankingApi of the ASPSP, the framework has to ensure equivalence between the PSU identified at the TPP and the PSU identified at the ASPSP. In this framework, we designed a two steps redirection FinTech -> TPP -> ASPSP knowing that this might make the process more cumbersome, but this design represents the superset of most of the cases found on the market. After thorough analysis of most scenarios, we noticed that the identity equivalence process can only securely happen in one of these ways: Alt-1: Sharing of Identity Provider If two involved entities (FinTech, TPP, ASPSP) share the same identity provider (IDP), the identity association process will be simple as the IDP will provide a common identifier. For example the subject claim of an identity token could lead to the verification of subject(alice123@tpp)==subject(alice-s@aspsp). Alt-2: No Sharing of Identity Provider If two parties are not sharing identity provider, a physical back redirection from the ASPSP to the TPP must be used to help complete the identity verification. Note that a physical back redirection will not be possible with the decoupled approach. Following sub-steps will be needed to ensure clean and secure physical back redirection in the example of a redirect from the TPP to the ASPSP: Make sure the physical back redirection sends the PSU to the Source PsuUserAgent The URL for the physical back redirection must have been protected against manipulation: - In case there is an initiation step present between TPP and ASPSP, use this step must have been used to transfer the back redirection url to the ASPSP (this is an example of the redirect approach of the NextGenPSD2 API). - In case there is no such initiation step (generally when OAuth is being used), make sure oAuth2 back redirection url templates and webOrigins are properly designed, as the concrete back redirection url is transported in the redirect_uri parameter of the consent request and exposed to attackers for manipulations. Verify Redirect State once in the Source PsuUserAgent A RedirectCookie must have been set on the PsuUserAgent while redirecting a user from the TPP (ConsentAuthorisationApi) to the ASPSP (OnlineBankingApi). The back redirection url to contains contains the state parameter that is used by the source PsuUserAgent to validate stored RedirectCookie. If a physical redirect can occur from the ASPSP (OnlineBankingApi) back to the TPP (ConsentAuthorisationApi), a validation of the original RedirectCookie can be taken as a guaranty to declare equivalence between the psu-id@tpp and the psu-id@aspsp . Alt-3: No Sharing of IDP and Decoupled-sca We define a decoupled approach as one where there no way of achieving physical (back) redirection between the source UIApp and the target UiApp. This generally happens when both are not on the same physical device. In this case a physical exchange muss happen. This physical information exchange is generally sufficient in one direction as the purpose is to make sure the PSU is physically in control of both devices (and UIApp credentials). Following are among other means for physical information exchange between two devices: Manual Code Transfer Physical sharing of state information between the source an the target of the redirection can be covered by having one side of the redirect enter a redirectCode displayed by the other side. In this case the redirectCode displayed is the handle for a more complex hash code shared over the back channel between source and target of the redirect. QR-Scan Physical sharing of state information between the source an the target of the redirection can be covered by having one side of the redirect (camera capable side) the possibility to scan a QR-Code displayed by the other side UIApp. Push notifications A push notification could be used to deep link the user into the target decoupled UIApp. To prevent spam, push notification shall only be done if the overall process can provide a sufficient level of confidence that the source side of the redirection identified the PSU before the initiation of the redirection process. The use of push notification can replaces the manual code or QR-scan described above. Limitation of Identity Equivalence for Existing OpenBanking Flows In some OpenBanking approaches, validating the consent at the OnlineBanking interface of the ASPSP directly finalizes authorization of the service request. The current state of the NextGenPSD2 specification for example finalizes a payment initiation with the act of a PSU authorizing the payment consent (either on the ASPSP or TPP interface), but future release are planing an additional step for the confirmation of the service request at the OpenBanking interface (after authorization). This additional step is necessary for to complete verification of the identity equivalence as described above. Recall that this weakness is only provided if the consent authorizing interface (OnlineBankingApi for redirect-sca or ConsentAuthorizationApi for embedded-sca) can not establish identity equivalence. Remember that if source and target share the same identity provider, target will generally be able establish identity equivalence and therefore authorized payment initiation can be release for execution without breach of the OpenBanking PSU Contract .","title":"PSU Security Concept"},{"location":"architecture/concepts/psu-security-concept/#psu-access-security-design","text":"","title":"PSU Access Security Design"},{"location":"architecture/concepts/psu-security-concept/#core-participants","text":"","title":"Core Participants"},{"location":"architecture/concepts/psu-security-concept/#security-considerations","text":"This work deals with details associated with the verification that the natural person that controls credentials used to authorize the initiation of a banking service at the TPP or ASPSP interface also controls credentials used to initiated that service at the FinTech interface.
