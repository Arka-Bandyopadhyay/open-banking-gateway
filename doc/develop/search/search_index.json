The initial effort focuses on the connectivity to banks that implement the European PSD2 directive either through one of the common market initiatives like : * The Berlin Group NextGenPSD2 , * The Open Banking UK , * The Polish PSD2 API or even through proprietary bank api like the ING\u2019s PSD2 API . What this Project is about Key Challenge for a TPPs PSD2 as the first regulatory driven Open Banking initiative offers many opportunities for both Banks and Third Party Providers. TPPs can use the account information and payment services provided by the banks in order to offer new innovative services to the end users. The more banks a TPP can interact with each other, the more end consumer can be provided with reacher banking solutions, which in turn simplifies and leverage commercial value chains. Being able to interact with different bank APIs can be a time and cost consuming challenge. Even though PSD2 sets a standard for bank interfaces, there is a lot of space for implementation options. A bank, therefore, can have it's own PSD2 compliant solution or implement one of the known market standards, like Open Banking UK, Berlin Group or STET. This open banking gateway will provide with a common interface with the aim of simplifying access to those APIs by third parties. Third Parties Contribution This project is designed to enable contribution from different sources, as the open banking challenge will start with a magnitude of discrepancies in individual bank implementations, even for banks implementing a common standards. The following picture displays the overall architecture of this banking gateway: Releases and versions Versioning, Release and Support policy Release notes Roadmap for next features development Initial Requirements Testing API with Postman json collections For testing API of the banking gateway it is used Postman https://www.getpostman.com/ Environment jsons with global parameter\u2019s sets and Collections of jsons for imitation of processes flows are stored in /postman folder.

Generally bank search is provided to prevent PSU from manually entering complicated bank identifiers. This bank search API allows for incremental keyword based search. Implementation Approaches We will distinguish between remote and local incremental search. Remote Incremental Search The remote incremental search is implemented on the server side. A rest endpoint receives a searchString and return a list of matching search entries. Use Case Steps Use cases for this API: 1. PSU loads FinTechSearchScreen 2. FinTechUI displays a search screen to the PSU 3. PSU enters any keyword in the search input field 4. FinTechUI forward request to FinTechAPI 5. FinTechAPI forward request to TppBeanSearchApi 6. TppBankSearchApi returns a list of matching BankDescriptors to FinTechAPI 7. FinTechAPI returns a list of matching BankDescriptors to FinTechBankSearchUI 8. UI displays list of found bank descriptors to PSU Step 4. through 8. is repeated as long as PSU modifies keywords (by adding or removing characters) Local Incremental Search Local incremental search generally provides a way of reducing round trip to servers. So there is no local incremental search endpoint, but an endpoint to download the list of all BankDescriptors. The client is then responsible for the indexing and the implementation of the search logic. For the purpose of keeping the client code simple, interface will also provide the possibility of downloading a standard lucene index file, as many platform provide login provide processing of lucene indexes. This approach will prevent each client from perfoming the expensive lucene indexing. The following diagram describes additional steps performed in the local incremental search. Use Case Steps Use cases for this API: 1. PSU loads FinTechSearchScreen 2. FinTechUI requests the BankSearchIndex from FinTechApi 3. FinTechApi requests the BankSearchIndex from TppBeanSearchApi 4. TppBeanSearchApi return BankSearchIndex to FinTechApi 5. FinTechApi return BankSearchIndex to FinTechUI 6. FinTechUI displays a search screen to the PSU 7. PSU enters any keyword in the search input field 8. FinTechUI call the search routine of the embedded LuceneSearch 9. LuceneSearch uses the keyword to retrieve the list of matching entries 10. LuceneSearch returns a list of matching BankDescriptors to FinTechBankSearchUI 11. UI displays list of found bank descriptors to PSU Step 8. through 11. is repeated as long as PSU modifies keywords (by adding or removing characters) Like this diagram shows, local bank search does not send request to the network. New Idioms Discriminator A discriminator can be used to limit the size of the index returned to client. If for example the TPP does not support some banks, there is no need for returning those banks to the client. LuceneSearch This is the UI-Komponent that operates on a lucene search index in the UI-Application. Caching Search Index SearchIndex might be cached on client as adding and removing bank records to the configuration does not happen frequently.","title":"Search bank"},{"location":"architecture/2-searchBank/#psu-searches-bank-by-keyword","text":"","title":"PSU Searches Bank By Keyword"},{"location":"architecture/2-searchBank/#definition","text":"Describes the bank search functionality in a FinTech Application.

Initiates a consent request if necessary. Generally the consent request is not explicitly initiated by the PSU. When the PSU requests for a banking service, if the FinTech has an existing consent that covers the service, no new consent will be initiated. Diagram Use Cases InitConsent-010 : FinTechUI displays BankProfile to PSU The result of a bank selection is that the FinTechUI displays the BankProfile to the PSU. The bank profile also contains the list of services offered by the selected bank. InitConsent-020 : PSU selects a service (Like listTransactions) The FinTechUI will forward the service selected to the FinTechApi. In this case listTransactions(BankProfile). The selection might be accompanied with some service specifications. For example in the case of listTransactions, this can be the iban of the target account. We will call this ListTransactionsSpec. InitConsent-030 : FinTechUI to FinTechApi.listTransactions The attached FinTechLoginSessionCookie is used to maintain session between PSU and FinTech. The attached UserAgentContext describes details associated with the user agent of the PSU. The given BankProfile contains meta information associated with the selected Bank. The ListTransactionsSpec specifies details of the service requested by the PSU. InitConsent-031 : Load PsuConsentSession A PsuConsentSession is a reusable token, that can be used to request service with the TppBankingApi. It is reference to the PSU in the realm of the TPP. Whether a service request is covered by an existing PsuConsent is decided by the TppBankingApi. The Task of the FinTechApi is to load any existing PsuConsentSession and associate it with the PSU. InitConsent-040 : FinTechApi to TppBankingApi.listTransactions The associated FinTechContext contains identification information associated with the FinTech. PsuConsentSession UserAgentContext BankProfile ListTransactionsSpec InitConsent-041 : Loads the BankingProtocol from the given BankProfile TppBankingApi selects the BankingProtocol based on the given BankProfile. InitConsent-050 : TppBankingApi to BankingProtocol.listTransactions The BankingProtocol associated with the given BankProfile decides on how to proceed with the request. BankingProtocol can: InitConsent-051 : Load TppConsentSession If there is existing consent associated with the PSU for the given service, the BankingProtocol will load the corresponding TppConsentSession . Information needed to load the TppConsentSession is contained in the given PsuConsentSession . Use the loaded TppConsentSession to retrieve an existing consent and proceed to the ASPSP with the service request. No Suitable Consent Present InitConsent-060 : Initiating a Consent with the ASPSP If there is no suitable consent available, the BankingProtocol will first proceed with a consent initiation request.. This is, an initiated service request will either ends up in the expected service response or first redirect the PSU to the ConsentAuthorisationApi . Whether this operation is necessary or not depends on the AspspBankingApi interface. The selected banking protocol will know how to deal with this. The Associated TppContext contains Tpp identifying information. InitConsent-061 : ConsentInit Response The response of the consent init request depends on the ASPSP implementation. It generally provides information needed to collect PSU identification information in the embedded case or information needed to redirect the PSU to the OnlineBankingApi . The result of a consent init session also carries an TppConsentSession , containing all information needed to be stored by the Tpp for the reference of the started consent session. InitConsent-062 : BankingProtocol calls RedirectSessionStoreApi for a redirectCode InitConsent-063 : RedirectSessionStoreApi The RedirectSessionStoreApi will encrypt and store the redirect session, indexing it with a redirectCode that can be used upon redirection by the ConsentAuthorisationApi to retrieve the corresponding TppConsentSession . InitConsent-063a : Encryption Encryption is performed to prevent unlawfull use of contained information in the Tpp's backend environment during the redirect session. InitConsent-063b : Storage an Expiration Encrypted TppConsentSession shall only be stored for the duration of the redirect session. InitConsent-063c : Auto Cleanup Auto Cleanup process will make sure all expired redirect sessions are removed from that storage. InitConsent-064 : RedirectSessionStoreApi returns redirectCode to BankingProtocol The redirectCode is a one time string that contains information used to retrieve redirectInfo from the TPP Server in a back channel. The redirectCode is short lived (like 10 seconds). This is, TPP server does not need to hold the record indexed by this redirectCode for more than the given expiration time. Record must also be deleted by the TPP on first retrieval by the ConsentAPI. InitConsent-065 : BankingProtocol reproduces PsuConsentSession from the TppConsentSession InitConsent-066 : Resulting Redirect Information is returned to the TppBankingApi The attached AspspRedirectInfo contains all information necessary to redirect the PSU to the ConsentAuthorisationApi .

These are: - PSU banking identifier information known as (psuId, psuCorporateId) - PSU account details information (like account numbers, iban, ...) - PSU payment orders (including beneficiary names, amounts, ...) - PSU authentication methods All these information are stored in different devices during the consent authorization session. Form of storages are among others: - Held in the browser page for display to the PSU - Stored in the Cookie for reuse by the corresponding backend - Stored in backend databases for transfer to other server components - Stored in backend databases for reuse by server components. For the purpose of protecting these data, framework is designed to always have consent data encrypted while at rest or on transit. General logic is that encrypted payload and encryption key do not reside in the same environment, unless need for decryption and processing of those data. Following object hold consent data - TppConsentSession - RedirectSession - PsuConsentSession PsuUserDevice A PSU user device runs applications used by the PSU to access banking functionality. Those applications are generally called PsuUgerAgents. PsuUserAgent Application running on a PSU device and used by the PSU to access banking functionality. We are describing the two main types of PsuUserAgents. WebBrowser A Web browser is considered compliant in the context of this framework when it can protect specific information used between the PusUserDevice and the the corresponding server application to track the user session. For session tracking, this framework uses Cookies RFC6265 . Security Considerations The use of cookies provides the most elaborated way to protect a session established between a WebBrowser and server application. We assume a WebBrowser storing a cookie fulfills following requirements: - Cookies carrying the attribute HttpOnly are not provided access to scripts run by the UserAgent. - Cookies carrying the attribute Secure are only resent to the server over SSL connections. - Expired Cookies (attribute Expires ) are not resent to the server. - Cookies shall never be transmitted to a domain not matching it's origin. Redirection The server can request the WebBrowser to redirect the user to another page by returning a 30[X] response code to the WebBrowser. Redirection will generally happens in the same Browser environment. We will be using redirection to switch the user context from one application to another one. Following redirection will generally be found in this framework: - FinTechApi to-> ConsentAuthorisationApi - ConsentAuthorisationApi to-> OnlineBankingApi - OnlineBankingApi backTo-> ConsentAuthorisationApi - ConsentAuthorisationApi backTo-> FinTechApi Redirection and Data Sharing We assume all three applications FinTechApi, ConsentAuthorisationApi, OnlineBankingApi are hosted on different domains. This is, we are not expecting Cookies set by one application to be visible to another application (this might still happen on some local development environment, where everything runs on localhost). We also do not advice adding persistent information to RedirectUrl , as these are log files everywhere on infrastructure components in data centers. RedirectUrl shall instead carry OneTime and ShortLived authorization code we call code , that can be used to retrieved shared payload through an authenticated back channel connection. This is the practice borrowed from oAuth2 RFC6749 . Following table shows defined redirects and corresponding back chanel endpoints. Origin Application Redirecting Application Response Code; Location ; AuthCodeParam; Expiration Redirect Target Application Destination Application Data EndPoint at Origin Application TppBankingApi FinTechApi 302 ; /auth ; code ; 5s ConsentAuthorisationApi ConsentAuthorisationApi /loadTppConsentSession ConsentAuthorisationApi ConsentAuthorisationApi Proprietary banking API. Assume RFC6749. /auth OnlineBankingApi OnlineBankingApi none OnlineBankingApi OnlineBankingApi 302 ; [/ok|/nok] ; code ; 5s ConsentAuthorisationApi ConsentAuthorisationApi /token ConsentAuthorisationApi ConsentAuthorisationApi 302 ; [/ok|/nok] ; code ; 5s FinTechApi TppBankingApi /loadTppConsentSession Keeping Session Information We assume all three applications FinTechApi, ConsentAuthorisationApi, OnlineBankingApi maintain their own session information. This framework uses following terms to name the session information held by an application on the UserAgent of the PSU. Application SessionCookie FinTechApi Psu2FintechLoginSession ConsentAuthorisationApi ConsentAuthSessionCookie OnlineBankingApi OnlineBankingConsentSessionCookie Session information can also be kept across redirect life cycles. Upon redirecting the UserAgent to another application, the redirecting application can set Cookies that will be resent to the domain with future requests. This way, there will be no need to maintain user session information in temporary databases on the server, thus keeping server tiny. Native App The UserAgent might be a native application running on a user mobile device or a desktop computer. In this case, redirection might still take place, but with consideration of the physical transition between source and target UI-Application. Following specifications deal with security threads associated with the redirection between UI-Application on a user device: RFC8252:OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps , RFC7636:Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients For the purpose of kepping the overall architecture of this framework simple, we will require native applications to provide the same behavior as the WebBrowser described above. UserAgentContext All information associated with the PsuUserAgent. Like PSU-IP-Address, PSU-IP-Port, PSU-Accept, PSU-Accept-Charset, PSU-Accept-Encoding, PSU-Accept-Language, PSU-Device-ID, PSU-User-Agent, PSU-Geo-Location, PSU-Http-Method. Many backend API will require provisioning of the UserAgentContext to perform verification of the authenticity of the original PSU request and to customize the response produced for intermediary layers. FinTechUI UI Application running on the PsuUserAgent and used by the PSU to access the FinTechApi ConsentAuthorisationUI UI used by PSU to authoraise consent in embedded case. OnlineBankingUI This UI manages the interaction between the PSU and the ASPSP in redirect cases. FinTechDC Data center environment of the FinTech. Host the FinTechApi. FinTechApi Financial web service provided by the FinTech. FinTechLoginSessionCookie This is a cookie used to maintain the login session between the FinTechUI and the FinTechApi. As this maintains the login state of the PSU in the FinTechUI, this session can be kept open for the life span of the interaction between the FinTechUI and the FinTechApi. FinTechLoginSessionState This is the CSRF-State String associated with the FinTechLoginSessionCookie. This information must be presented whenever the FinTechApi consumes the FinTechLoginSessionCookie. It encodes a key that is used to encrypt/decrypt information stored in the corresponding FinTechLoginSessionCookie. Fintech2TppRedirectInfoPage This panel will be used to inform the PSU upon redirecting the PSU to the ConsentAuthorisationApi. This information step is recommended as changes in UI display between the FinTechUI and the ConsentAuthorisationUI might confuse the PSU. Tpp Data Center Data center environment of the TPP TppBankingApi Tpp backend providing access to ASPSP banking functionality. This interface is not directly accessed by the PSU but by the FinTechApi. FinTechApi will use a FinTechContext to authenticate with the TppBankingApi. TppBankSearchApi Repository of banks maintained in the TPP's banking gateway. The banking search API will later presen an interface to configure profiles attached to listed banks. BankDescriptor Descriptive information assocaited with a bank like: - The name of the Bank - The address of the bank - The bank identification code BankProfile BankingApi profile information associated with a bank like: - The BankingProtocol used to connect with the bank - List of Banking services provided by the BankingApi of the bank - SCA approcahes associated with the BankingApi - ScaUIMetadaData: Screens and field used to collect user authentication data. - Actions to be performed by the PSU prior to using the BankingProtocol AisConsentSpec Specification associated with an AisConsent. This is highly dependent on the BankProfile. Following information might be carried by an AisConsentSpec object: - recurringIndicator - validUntil - frequencyPerDay - combinedService - accountAccessTemplate - availableAccounts[availableAccountsWithBalances, allAccounts] - allPsd2[allAccounts] FinTechContext Information used to identify the FinTech application at the TppBankingApi. For example a FinTech SSL client certificate or an APIKey or an oAuth2 Password Grant Credential. PsuConsentSession Information associated with the consent as exchanged between the FinTechApi and the TppBankingApi. Generally contains: - Data needed to customize psu access at the ConsentAuthorisationApi (showInfoPanel, fintechStateHash) - Data needed to manage redirection of PSU from the TppConsentSession to the FintechUI like (FinTech-Redirect-URI, FinTech-Nok-Redirect-URI, FinTech-Explicit-Authorisation-Preferred, FinTech-Content-Negotiation) Object also contains information associated with the PSU requesting service if available. - The identifier of the PSU in the realm of the Tpp PsuIdentifier - Existing Consent References if any. PsuIdentifier This is the identifier of the PSU in the FinTech2Tpp relationship. This identifier can be saved once a consent has been successfully established to allow for reuse of existing consent in future sessions. ConsentAuthorisationApi Interface used by the PSU to authorize a consent. ConsentAuthSessionCookie This is the cookie object used to maintain the consent session between the ConsentAuthorisationUI and the ConsentAuthorisationApi. It will generated and set as a httpOnly, Secure This cookie will generally contain the identifier of the TppContentSession and the cryptographic key used to read that TppContentSession. consentAuthState This is the CSRF-State String associated with the ConsentAuthSessionCookie. It encodes a key that is used to encrypt information stored in the corresponding ConsentAuthSessionCookie. This is: consentAuthState = state-id + consentEncryptionKey All requests to the ConsentAuthorisationApi must always provide the consentAuthState as a X-XRSF-Token and set a ConsentAuthSessionCookie as a cookie. Passing a consentAuthState to the UI. - For 30X Redirect Requests, this is passed to the UI as a URL query param part of the redirect URL. - For 20X Responses, this is part of the returned response body (AuthorizeResponse). The consentAuthState shall never be stored in the ConsentAuthSessionCookie. As a redirect request carries the consentAuthState in parameter, a new consentAuthState shall be generated after each redirect and returned back to the client, as the old one is probably leaked into log files as part of a request URI. RedirectSession Holds consent information for the duration of a redirect. Redirect patterns are described below . RedirectSessionStoreApi Storage of temporary redirect sessions. Redirect session are stored only for the duration of the redirect request while redirecting from the TppBankingApi to the ConsentAuthorisationApi and from the ConsentAuthorisationApi back to the TppBankingApi. Consent Data might contain security sentive data like account number or payment information of the PSU. This is the reason why they will be encrypted prior to being temporarily held for the duration of the redirection in the RedirectSessionStoreApi. So the RedirectSessionStoreApi will generate a temporary authorization code that contains both the id of the redirect session and the key used to encrypt the content of the redirect session. Upon request, the RedirectSessionStoreApi will use the provided authorization code to read and decrypt the consent session and will delete the consent session prior to returning it for the first time to the caller. BankingProtocol Component managing access to a banking interface initiative. WE will have to deal with many protocols like NextGenPSD2, HBCI, OpenBanking UK, PolishAPI. BankingProtocolSelector Help select a banking protocol. Aspsp Data Center Data center environment of the ASPSP AspspBankingApi Api banking provided by ASPSP. This interface is not directly accessed by the PSU but by the TppBankingApi. TppBankingApi will use a TppContext to authenticate with the TppBankingApi. TppContext Information used to identify the Tpp application in the ASPSP environment. Like a TPP QWAC certificate. TppConsentSession Storage for consent data in the realm of the BankingProtocol. The banking protocol is both accessible to the TppBankingApi and the ConsentAuthorizationApi. The cryptographic key needed to recover the TppConsentSession is always delivered by the calling layer. These are: - FinTechUI -> FinTechApi -> TppBankingApi -> BankingProtocol : in this case the key needed to recover the TppConsentSession in contained in the PsuConsentSession. Generally that key will transitively originate from an interaction with the user agent. - CosentAuthorizationUI -> CosentAuthorizationApi -> BankingProtocol : in this case the key needed to recover the TppConsentSession originate from the ConsentAuthSessionCookie. Beside consent data, additional data might be held in the TppConsentSession: - FinTechContext : Data needed to authorize the FinTechApi (FinTechSSLCertificate, ApiKey, SignedJWT) - Additional information needed for interaction between TPP and ASPSP but without any concern to the PSU. OnlineBankingApi Generally the online banking application on an ASPSP. In redirect cases, the ASPSP OnlineBankingApi establishes a direct session with the PSU to allow the PSU to identify himself, review and authorize the consent. OnlineBankingConsentSessionCookie This is a Cookie used to maintain the session between the OnlineBankingUI and the OnlineBankingApi. As a recommendation, the validity of this Cookie shall be limited to the life span of the consent session. As the OnlineBankingApi redirects the PSU back to the ConsentAuthorisationApi up on completion of the consent session. Redirection happens independently on whether the consent was authorized or not. OnlineBanking2ConsentAuthRedirectInfoPage It is recommended to inform the PSU prior to redirecting the PSU back to the TPP. This UI-Panel will be called OnlineBanking2ConsentAuthRedirectInfoPage. If the ASPSP is using a trusted environment (Native App) and wants to keep the relationship to the PSU alive, it is necessary to store this relationship in a separated OnlineBankingLoginSessionCookie. OnlineBankingLoginSessionCookie This Cookie will be used by the ASPSP to keep a login session of the PSU over the life span of consent session. This will prevent the PSU from performing the login step for upcoming consent sessions.","title":"Dictionary"},{"location":"architecture/dictionary/#dictionary","text":"","title":"Dictionary"},{"location":"architecture/dictionary/#webbrowser","text":"A Web browser is considered compliant in the context of this framework when it can protect specific information used between the PusUserDevice and the the corresponding server application to track the user session.
